Miraglio's Starter Theme for WordPress
===

Starter theme meant for hacking. Includes ultra-minimal CSS.

* A modern workflow with a pre-made command-line interface to turn your project into a more pleasant experience.
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php`.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and prevent code duplication.
* Small tweaks in `inc/template-functions.php` to improve theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry.
* 2 layouts in `sass/layouts/` made using CSS Grid for a sidebar on either side of the content.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` to help to quickly get the design off the ground.
* Full support for `WooCommerce plugin` integration with hooks in `inc/woocommerce.php`.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later.
